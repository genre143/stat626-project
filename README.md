The stock market is a tricky creature. In a free market, buyers invest and sell stocks for their personal and monetary gain, but
this fluctuates based on extreme volatility in the market. The most diversified and perhaps most attractive stock exchange to
the public is the S&P 500, which is often considered to be more robust to inflation. This inflation has been more pervasive in
its influence in the last 10 years, especially taking into account the pandemic stock drop, supply chain issues, semiconductor
chip shortage, tech layoffs, and other major events that may have influenced the volatility of the stock market close price.
Despite these favorable characteristics of the S&P 500, it is hardly affordable for the average person to buy, manage, or sell
all 500 of the largest companies listed on stock exchanges. In our analysis we will use SPY time series, a more accessible
type of investment fund that is traded on the stock market; the value of one share of this ETF is approximately 1/10 of the
cash value of S&P stock. Given the SPY time series from 1993-01-29 to 2023-03-31, our goal is to understand factors
affecting the volatility of the stock market and forecast future stock market daily returns, assuming we invest a certain
amount of money today.
